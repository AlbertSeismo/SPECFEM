README - homogeneous halfspace using externally defined source time function
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example uses an externally defined source time function with the 
homogeneous halfspace mesh to run a forward simulation. The externally
provided source time function here is the same as the one used by
default in the homogeneous halfspace example when the source time function is 
not externally provided. Hence, the output seismograms should look the same 
as those in the default example.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
The first line of the source time function file is the value of the time step 
same as the simulation time step and the following lines are the values of the
moment vs. time function, and NOT the moment rate vs. time function.

Step-by-step tutorial:

1. This example needs to be run as part of the homogeneous_halfspace example -
   ./EXAMPLES/homogeneous_halfspace/README
   Or
   ./EXAMPLES/homogeneous_halfspace/README_internal_mesh

2. Make the following modifications before running the solver -
   
   a. Copy the "source_time_funtion.txt" file to the specfem working directory.
      > cp EXAMPLES/homogeneous_halfspace/source_time_function.txt .   

   b. In the CMTSOLUTION file, add the full name of the source time function file
      "source_time_funtion.txt" as the ending line.

   c. In the Par_file, set 'USE_EXTERNAL_SOURCE_FILE = .true.'.

3. Compare the seismograms with reference seismograms -
   > xmgrace EXAMPLES/homogeneous_halfspace/REF_SEIS/*Z.semd
   > xmgrace OUTPUT_FILES/*Z.semd
